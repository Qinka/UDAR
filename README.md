# UDAR

This repo is a demo of **Ultrasound Detection And Ranging**, UDAR for short.
This demo includes a hardware design and a host software.
The hardware includes two servos, a ultrasound ranging module and FPGA IP core.
The host software will include the control program and other programs.

## Hardware

The hardware includes:

* 2-D holder
* Two servos for holder's x-axis and y-axis.
* Ultrasound ranging module(URM).
* ZigBee module(option)

The holder with two servos can change the direction of URM to $(x,y)$
